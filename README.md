<h2>Dataset and why I chose specific columns</h2>
Dataset attached to this homework is far from perfect. In order to predict / classify if the plannet is similar to Earth, we would need more columns from Transit Properties. Transit Properties contains properites of the planet which can identify similarity to Earth.

<h2>Assumptions and analysis</h2>
I did not assume anything before analysis of this dataset, moslty because I do not see chosen columns as the most useful. I believe results could improve if we have more Transit Properties columns available.
